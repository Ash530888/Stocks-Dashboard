# Stock Dashboard
I decided to use Dash to implement this python-based web app as itâ€™s specifically designed for building interactive data visualization apps with minimal boilerplate code. Dash, which is built on top of Flask, provides many built-in components for handling data visualization and interactivity, making it ideal for creating dashboards like this one.
